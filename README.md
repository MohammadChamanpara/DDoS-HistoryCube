# History Cube
This project is an implementation of History Cube a customization on the STONE framework which is an effective Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) defense mechanism.

History Cube uses binary memory which is a new idea how to store huge lists of numbers in a compacted fashion and retrievable very fast.
This approach enabled us not be dependent on Database during the detection process and only rely on the server memory(RAM).

## DoS Attack
In computing, a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) is a cyber-attack where the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet.

## DDoS Attack
Denial-of-service attacks are characterized by an explicit attempt by attackers to prevent legitimate users of a service from using that service. In a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources â€“ potentially hundreds of thousands or more. This effectively makes it impossible to stop the attack simply by blocking a single IP address; plus, it is very difficult to distinguish legitimate user traffic from attack traffic when spread across so many points of origin. 

## STONE
STONE, a stream-based DDoS defense framework, which integrates anomaly-based DDoS detection and mitigation with scalable data streaming technology. With STONE, the traffic of potential targets is analyzed via continuous data streaming queries maintaining information used for both attack detection and mitigation. STONE provides minimal degradation of legitimate users traffic during DDoS attacks and it also faces effectively flash crowds.
